A program to convert Seabird cnv-files into netcdf format

This is needed several times when trying to make plots with programs using the netcdf-format as input. Althoug the Seabird cnv-format is pretty selfdescribing netcdf seems to be a better choice to keep all information on the data together.

The tools developed here are made to be used for the IOW version of cnv header formats. It may not work for the original cnv format. 

This repository is under development.
